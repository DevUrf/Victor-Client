### Code formatting
Just follow the existing formatting.

In general, in order of importance:
* Make sure your IDE is not messing up line endings or whitespace and avoid using linters.
* Prefer readability over dogma.
* Keep to the existing formatting.
* Indent with 4 space unless it's in a submodule.
* Keep lists (of arguments, parameters, initializers...) as lists, not paragraphs. It should either read from top to bottom, or left to right. Not both.

## Forking/Redistributing/Custom builds policy
<b>We keep Launcher Closed Source because we think it's important to give the <b>Developers</b> privacy for a project like this, and we do so using the Apache license.</b>

The license gives you access to the source <b>Victor Client</b> is built from, but not:
- The name, logo and other branding.
- The API tokens required to talk to services that the launcher depends on.

Because of the nature of the agreements required to interact with the Microsoft identity platform, it's impossible for us to continue allowing everyone to build the code as 'Victor Client'. The source code has been debranded and now builds as `DevLauncher` by default.

You must provide your own branding if you want to distribute your own builds.[Join Discord to help](https://discord.com)

You will also have to register your own app on Azure to be able to handle Microsoft account logins.

If you decide to fork the project, a mention of its origins in the About dialog and the license is acceptable. However, it should be abundantly clear that the project is a fork <b>*without*</b> implying that you have our blessing.
